Tech Stack Guidelines for Kuavo Data Challenge (Version 1.1 - Validated)

1. Executive Summary

This document specifies the complete and mandatory technology stack for the Kuavo Data Challenge software. The project's objective is to provide an end-to-end Imitation Learning (IL) pipeline for humanoid robots.

The architecture is built upon a Python foundation leveraging ROS Noetic libraries for hardware control and a cutting-edge PyTorch 2.x / CUDA 12.x stack for policy training. Crucially, this project uses NumPy 2.x and PyTorch 2.7+, requiring careful attention to dependency management to avoid ABI incompatibilities with legacy robotics libraries.

2. Core Programming Language and Environment

Primary Language: Python

Specific Version: Python 3.10+ (Required for PyTorch 2.7 and NumPy 2.x compatibility).

Justification: The core logic relies on modern features and performance optimizations found in recent Python releases.

Environment Management:

Tool: Conda or Docker (Strongly Recommended).

Guidance for AI: The requirements_total.txt contains a mix of system-level ROS bindings (rospy, cv_bridge) and standard PyPI packages. A pure pip install might fail without system libraries (libboost, etc.). Use the provided Dockerfile or a Conda environment with conda-forge channels for ROS dependencies.

3. Deep Learning & Imitation Learning Framework

3.1. Core ML Framework

Library: PyTorch

Specific Version: 2.7.1

Hardware Acceleration: CUDA 12.6 (via nvidia-cuda-runtime-cu12==12.6.77).

Justification: Bleeding-edge PyTorch version provided for maximum performance on NVIDIA Ampere/Ada Lovelace GPUs.

3.2. Imitation Learning Library

Library: LeRobot (Hugging Face)

Specific Version: Installed in editable mode (-e third_party/lerobot).

Justification: Provides the standardized ACT/Diffusion architectures. Patched locally via lerobot_patches.

3.3. Diffusion Models

Library: Diffusers (Hugging Face)

Specific Version: 0.34.0

Justification: The backbone for the Diffusion Policy scheduler and noise prediction.

3.4. Configuration Management

Library: Hydra (hydra-core)

Specific Version: 1.3.2

Library: OmegaConf

Specific Version: 2.3.0

Justification: Mandatory for managing hierarchical YAML configurations (configs/).

4. Robotics Middleware & Data Processing

4.1. Middleware

System: ROS Noetic compatible.

Library: rospy==1.17.4, rosbag==1.17.4, sensor-msgs==1.13.2.

Justification: The project explicitly pins ROS Python bindings to match Noetic's final release versions, ensuring protocol compatibility with the robot hardware.

4.2. Reinforcement/Imitation Learning Interface

Library: Gymnasium

Specific Version: 0.29.1

Justification: The standard API for agent-environment interaction.

4.3. Data Ingestion & Image Processing

Library: OpenCV (opencv-python)

Specific Version: 4.12.0.88

Library: NumPy

Specific Version: 2.2.6 (WARNING: Major version 2.x. Ensure legacy C-extensions are compatible).

Library: PyArrow

Specific Version: 21.0.0

Justification: High-performance data manipulation and Parquet storage.

4.4. Robot SDK

Library: kuavo_humanoid_sdk

Version: Local/Internal package.

5. Logging & Experiment Tracking

Library: WandB (Weights & Biases)

Specific Version: 0.21.0

Justification: Remote experiment tracking and artifact versioning.

Library: TensorBoard

Specific Version: 2.20.0

Justification: Local training metrics visualization.

6. Deployment & Hardware Acceleration

NVIDIA Stack:

nvidia-cudnn-cu12==9.5.1.17

nvidia-nccl-cu12==2.26.2

Justification: Full CUDA 12 ecosystem support for distributed training and fast inference.
