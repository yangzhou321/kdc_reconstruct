# Codebase Commenting Guidelines

## Philosophy

Our primary goal for commenting is *clarity and maintainability**. In a TypeScript codebase, types already provide significant information about the *what*. Therefore, our comments should focus on the **why**, the **intent**, and the **complexities* that aren't immediately obvious from the code and types alone.

We use *JSDoc* as the standard format. This provides structure, integrates well with TypeScript's language server for enhanced IntelliSense, and offers a consistent format for both human developers and AI systems interacting with our code.

Comments should add value. Avoid redundant comments that merely restate the obvious or duplicate type information. Prioritize commenting public APIs, complex logic, and non-intuitive decisions.

## Core Standard: JSDoc

All multi-line comments explaining functions, classes, types, components, hooks, or complex blocks should use the JSDoc format (`/** ... */`).

## When to Comment

Focus commenting efforts where they provide the most value:

1.  *Public APIs / Exports:*
    *   *Functions/Methods:* Explain purpose, parameters, return values, and any potential side effects or errors.
    *   *React Components:* Describe the component's purpose, its props, and any significant state or behavior. Use `@param` for props.
    *   *Custom Hooks:* Explain what the hook does, its parameters, and what it returns.
    *   *Utility Functions/Classes:* Document any exported helpers or classes intended for reuse.
    *   *Types/Interfaces:* Explain the purpose of complex or broadly used custom types if the name isn't self-explanatory.

2.  *Complex Logic:*
    *   If an algorithm, calculation, or piece of business logic is intricate or non-obvious, add comments explaining the approach and the reasoning behind it. Focus on the *why*.

3.  *Non-Obvious Decisions & Trade-offs:*
    *   If a particular implementation choice was made for specific reasons (performance, browser compatibility, workaround for a library bug), document it. This provides crucial context for future maintainers.

4.  *Important Constants or Configuration:*
    *   If the purpose of a constant isn't immediately clear from its name and value, add a brief explanation.

5.  *Workarounds and `TODO`s:*
    *   Use `// HACK:` or `// WORKAROUND:` for temporary fixes, explaining why the workaround is necessary and potentially linking to an issue tracker.
    *   Use `// TODO:` for planned improvements or missing features, ideally with context or an issue link.

6.  *Type Clarifications (Sparingly):*
    *   In rare cases where TypeScript's inference might be ambiguous or a type needs further semantic meaning, a JSDoc `@type` tag or explanation can help. However, prefer refining the TypeScript types themselves first.

## How to Comment with JSDoc (Essential Tags)

Use clear, concise English. Start block comments with a brief summary sentence.

```typescript
/**
 * [Summary sentence explaining the overall purpose.]
 *
 * [Optional: More detailed explanation, rationale, or context.]
 *
 * @param {Type} name - [Description of the parameter's purpose and expected value.]
 * @param {Type} [optionalName] - [Description for optional parameter. Use brackets.]
 * @param {Type} [nameWithDefault='default'] - [Description for parameter with default.]
 * @param {object} options - Description of the options object.
 * @param {string} options.id - Description of the 'id' property within options.
 * @param {number} [options.count] - Description of optional 'count' property.
 * @returns {ReturnType} - [Description of what the function returns and why/when.]
 * @throws {ErrorType} - [Description of when/why this error might be thrown.]
 * @deprecated [Reason for deprecation and/or alternative to use.]
 * @see {Link/Reference} - [Link to related functions, documentation, or issue tracker.]
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Example usage demonstrates how to call it.
 * const result = myFunction(inputValue);
 * console.log(result);
 * ```
 */
 function myFunction(name: string, options: { id: string; count?: number }): ReturnType {
   // ...implementation
 }

/**
 * Represents a user profile within the application.
 * Used across various UI components and API interactions.
 */
export type UserProfile = {
  /** Unique identifier for the user. */
  id: string;
  /** User's display name. May not be unique. */
  name: string;
  /** Optional email address. */
  email?: string;
};

/**
 * Renders the main application layout, including header and footer.
 *
 * @param {object} props - Component properties.
 * @param {React.ReactNode} props.children - Content to be rendered within the layout.
 * @returns {JSX.Element} The main application layout structure.
 */
export const MainLayout = ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }): JSX.Element => {
  // ...implementation
};
```

*Key JSDoc Tags to Use:*

*   *Description:* Always provide a clear summary. Add more detail if necessary.
*   *`@param {Type} name - Description`**: Essential for functions/methods/hooks. Explain the *role of the parameter. TypeScript handles the type, JSDoc explains the *purpose*.
*   *`@returns {Type} - Description`**: Explain *what is being returned and under what conditions, especially if it's complex or conditional.
*   *`@props {object} - Description`* (Often implicit via `@param` in functional components): Used for documenting component props object. Individual props can be documented using `@param {Type} props.propName - Description`.
*   **`@type {Type}`**: Use primarily for documenting constants or variables where type inference needs clarification (less common with explicit TS types).
*   **`@example`**: Very helpful for demonstrating usage, especially for utilities or complex functions.
*   **`@throws {ErrorType} - Condition`**: Document expected errors that callers might need to handle.
*   **`@deprecated - Reason/Alternative`**: Crucial for managing API evolution.
*   **`@see {Link/Reference}`**: Useful for linking to related code, external docs, or issue trackers.

## What NOT to Comment

*   *Obvious Code:* Don't explain code that is self-evident (e.g., `// Increment count` for `count++`).
*   *Exact Type Duplication:* Avoid comments that just re-state the TypeScript type (e.g., `/** @param {string} userId - The user ID /` when the TS signature is `userId: string`). Focus on *purpose if adding a `@param` comment.
*   *Version Control Information:* Don't add comments about authors or change history (`// Changed by John Doe on 2023-10-27`). Use `git blame` and commit history for this.
*   *Outdated Comments:* Delete or update comments ruthlessly if the code changes. Incorrect comments are worse than no comments.
*   *Commented-Out Code:* Remove dead code instead of commenting it out. Use version control to retrieve old code if needed.
